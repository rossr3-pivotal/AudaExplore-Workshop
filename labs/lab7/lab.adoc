= Lab - Binding to Services

== Building upon our Attendees Application

=== Data Model, Initialization and Connection Details

. Right click on the Project name and select Manage NuGet Packages
. Click the browse link 
. Search for mysql
. Select the MySql.Data.Entity by Oracle (v6.9.8) and click the Install Button. 
.. Click to accept the Changes
.. Click to accept the License
.. Close the readme.txt and NuGet tabs
. Navigate to the Models folder
. Create an Attendee.cs Class
.. Use the following code in this file. Be sure to pay attention to the namespace 
```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;

namespace MVCAttendees.Models
{
    public class Attendee
    {
        [Display(Name = "Attendee ID")]
        [Key]
        public int id { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = "First Name")]
        [StringLength(60)]
        public string firstName { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = "Last Name")]
        [StringLength(60)]
        public string lastName { get; set;  }

        [Display(Name = "Name")]
        public string name { get { return firstName + " " + lastName; } }

        [Display(Name = "Email Address")]
        [StringLength(255)]
        public string email { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = "Phone Number")]
        [StringLength(20)]
        public string phoneNumber { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = "Address")]
        [StringLength(60)]
        public string address { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = "City")]
        [StringLength(60)]
        public string city { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = "State")]
        [StringLength(40)]
        public string state { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = "Postal Code")]
        [StringLength(10)]
        public string zipCode { get; set; }
    }
}
```
. Add "using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;" to the using section of the class
. Save the Attendee Model class.
. Create a DAL folder in the project. 
. Create an AtttendeeContext.cs Class file in the DAL folder created above
.. Use the following code in this file. Be sure to pay attention to the namespace 
```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Data.Entity;
using System.Data.Entity.ModelConfiguration.Conventions;
using MVCAttendees.Models;

namespace MVCAttendees.DAL
{
    [DbConfigurationType(typeof(MySql.Data.Entity.MySqlEFConfiguration))]
    public class AttendeeContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<Attendee> Attendees { get; set; }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove<PluralizingTableNameConvention>();

            modelBuilder.Entity<Attendee>();
        }
    }
}
```
. Add the following to the using section
```C#
using System.Data.Entity;
using System.Data.Entity.ModelConfiguration.Conventions;
using MVCAttendees.Models;
```
. Save the AtttendeeContext.cs file
. Create an AttendeeInitializer.cs Class file in the DAL folder
.. Use the following code in this file. Be sure to pay attention to the namespace
```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using MVCAttendees.Models;

namespace MVCAttendees.DAL
{
    public class AttendeeInitializer : System.Data.Entity.DropCreateDatabaseAlways<AttendeeContext>
    {
        protected override void Seed(AttendeeContext context)
        {
            List<Attendee> attendees = new List<Attendee>
            {
            new Attendee{id=1,address="123 Main Street",city="San Diego",email="attendee1@gmail.com",firstName="John",lastName="Doe",phoneNumber="(800) 555-1212",state="CA",zipCode="92113"},
            new Attendee{id=2,address="456 Main Street",city="San Diego",email="attendee2@gmail.com",firstName="Jane",lastName="Smith",phoneNumber="(800) 555-1214",state="CA",zipCode="92113"},
            new Attendee{id=3,address="789 Main Street",city="San Diego",email="attendee3@gmail.com",firstName="Fred",lastName="Flintstone",phoneNumber="(800) 555-1215",state="CA",zipCode="92113"},
            new Attendee{id=4,address="203 Main Street",city="San Diego",email="attendee4@gmail.com",firstName="Betty",lastName="Rubble",phoneNumber="(800) 555-1216",state="CA",zipCode="92113"},
            };

            attendees.ForEach(a => context.Attendees.Add(a));
            context.SaveChanges();
       }
    }
}
```
. Add "using MVCAttendees.Models;" to the using section of the class
. Save the AttendeeInitializer.cs file
. Change the Web.Config to point to your local instance of MySQL
.. Open Web.Config
.. Add a connectionString section in the <configuration> node between the <configSections> and <appSettings>. If you changed the database name, user name and/or password, update the appropriate parts in the connection string. 
```XML
  </configSections>
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="AttendeeContext" connectionString="Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=pcfdemo;Uid=pcfuser;Pwd=pcfpwd" providerName="MySql.Data.MySqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>
  <appSettings>
```
. Scroll down in the Web.Config until you hit the <system.web> section
. Add the following node to the <system.web> section
```XML
   <customErrors mode="Off" />
```
. This will enable us to see the error in the browser for troubleshooting purposes. For production apps, this should be removed.
. In the same section, you need to add a <machineKey> section. The easiest way to do so is 
to open your browser and navigate to http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/generatemachinekey/[]. 
Click the Generate key button and copy the ASP.NET 2.0 Machine Key in the <system.web> section.
.. It should look something like this:
```XML
   <machineKey 
     validationKey="D2C3CAE8C7306CF89B830B065E727E06DFECF1E1F78B4ADDC4FF75E58E9C66367BCE7BA449A76BAFE3A70E46EA179BF63D2DF71BFAD99E09A0345056BE81FC3B"
     decryptionKey="34F3314ABE07E9DCE67A47705AEAB486DBC450B88BF0E3BC6F0FA321FDC7EEFB"
     validation="SHA1" decryption="AES"/>
```
Using a machine key is critical to scaling applications in Pivotal Cloud Foundry, just like
you would do in a traditional webfarm, to make sure that all servers have the same encryption 
and decryption values to deal with ASP.NET view state. 
. Scroll down in the Web.Config until you get to the <entityFramework> section
.. Add a contexts section at the beginning of the <entityFramework> section, be sure to pay attention to the namespace
```XML
    <contexts>
      <context type="MVCAttendees.DAL.AttendeeContext, MVCAttendees">
        <databaseInitializer type="MVCAttendees.DAL.AttendeeInitializer, MVCAttendees" />
      </context>
    </contexts>
```
. Save the Web.Config file

=== Updating the User Interface

. Add an AttendeeController to the Controllers folder
. Right Click the Controllers Folder, select Add | Controller...
.. For the Controller name use AttendeeController
.. Use the following code in the controller
```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;
using System.Linq;
using System.Net;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;
using MVCAttendees.DAL;
using MVCAttendees.Models;

namespace MVCAttendees.Controllers
{
    public class AttendeeController : Controller
    {
        private AttendeeContext db = new AttendeeContext();

        // GET: Attendee
        public ViewResult Index()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Getting ready to read the list of attendees");
            var attendees = from s in db.Attendees
                            select s;
            Console.WriteLine("Returning the list of attendees");
            return View(attendees);
        }
        
        protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            db.Dispose();
            base.Dispose(disposing);
        }
    }
}        
```
. Add the following to the using section
```C#
using MVCAttendees.DAL;
using MVCAttendees.Models;
```
. Save the AttendeeController
. Highlight the public ViewResult Index() method
. Right-click and select Add View
.. View Name: Index
.. Template: List
.. Model class: Attendee (MVCAttendees.Models)
.. Data context class: AttendeeContext (MVCAttendees.DAL)
.. Use a layout page: ~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml
. If you run into Visual Studio errors, open the AttendeeContext.cs and comment out the DbConfigurationType attribute and save the file.
```C#
namespace MVCAttendees.DAL
{
   // [DbConfigurationType(typeof(MySql.Data.Entity.MySqlEFConfiguration))]
    public class AttendeeContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<Attendee> Attendees { get; set; }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove<PluralizingTableNameConvention>();

            modelBuilder.Entity<Attendee>();
        }
    }
}
```
. Open the _Layout.cshtml file which is located in Views\Shared folder
. Change the "Application name" in the first Html.ActionLink to "Attendees"
.. It should look something like this:
```HTML
		@Html.ActionLink("Workshop App", "Index", "Home", new { area = "" }, new { @class = "navbar-brand" })
```
. Add an Html Action link to the navbar area of the file
.. It should look something like this:
```HTML
            <div class="navbar-collapse collapse">
                <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")</li>
                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("About", "About", "Home")</li>
                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Contact", "Contact", "Home")</li>
                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Attendees", "Index", "Attendee")</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
```
. Save the file and run the project. You should the following screen
image::appwithattendeesmenu.png[]
. Click on the Attendees link and you should see the following screen
image::appwithattendeeslist.png[]

=== Running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry

Before we can push the application to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, we need to provision a MySQL 
service and inject the credentials into our Web.Config. If we were to push the application 
at this point, we would see an exception because it would not be able to connect to the database.

==== Binding to Services

First, let's provision a new MySQL server instance with the default plan. To see what s
ervices are available, run the following command:
+

----

We want to create a service. 

. Run the following command
+
----
> cf create-service p-mysql 100mb-dev attendeeDb
----
. Now bind the service to our application. 
+
----
> cf bind-service wsattendees attendeeDb
----

The way Pivotal Cloud Foundry binds to .NET applications via the web config is through a 
https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/user-provided.html[User Provided Service] 
and not through the normal service binding mechanism. In order to get the credentials from 
the service we just bound to, we need to look at the environment variables associated with 
our application

----
> cf env wsattendees
Getting env variables for app wsattendees in org instructor / space development as instructor...
OK

System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "p-mysql": [

... // additional service information removed for brevity 
----

Now we need to create the user-provided service and bind that to the application. The user 
provided service needs three parameters: name, connectionString and providerName. These 
correspond to the connection paratmers within the web.config. 
. The first step is to create the user provided service with the name attendeeUPS

----
> cf create-user-provided-service attendeeUPS -p "name, connectionString, providerName"
----
.. For the Name use AttendeeContext -- Note: This MUST match the existing name in your 
<connectionStrings> section in the web.config file
.. For the connectionString use the same format that is in the web.config, and substitute 
your service credentials above. In this case it would look like this
... Server=10.68.144.104;Port=3306;Database=cf_6ef3be55_6bd6_49cf_89b7_6b91af126684;Uid=TePqTk1oV9NmaFW6;Pwd=UTFPBbyD6hJnOAFO
... Where the Server maps to the hostname, Database maps to the name, Uid maps to username and Pwd maps to password
.. For the ProviderName use MySql.Data.MySqlClient - the same value that is in your web.config. The output should look like this:
+
----
> cf create-user-provided-service attendeeUPS -p "name, connectionString, providerName"

name> AttendeeContext

connectionString> Server=10.68.144.104;Port=3306;Database=cf_6ef3be55_6bd6_49cf_89b7_6b91af126684;Uid=TePqTk1oV9NmaFW6;Pwd=UTFPBbyD6hJnOAFO

providerName> MySql.Data.MySqlClient
Creating user provided service attendeeUPS in org instructor / space development as instructor...
OK
----
. Now we need to bind the application to our newly created user provided service
+
----
> cf bind-service wsattendees attendeeUPS
Binding service attendeeUPS to app wsattendees in org instructor / space development as instructor...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage wsattendees' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----
. Now we are ready to push our application again.

==== Publishing and Pushing the .NET Application

. Publish the .NET applicaiton by right-clicking on the project name and selecting publish. Use the same profile as was used before.
